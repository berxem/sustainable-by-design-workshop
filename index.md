In this workshop, we invite researchers, designers, and practitioners to explore together how life-cycle thinking can contribute to the design of intelligent, sustainable mobility solutions. While current research primarily focuses on making the usage period of such solutions more sustainable, we aim to take a broader perspective by integrating sustainability from the earliest design stages through to the end of the vehicle's life. Therefore, we will use speculative and critical design thinking to inspire and explore challenges as well as opportunities concerning sustainability at every stage of the life-cycle, from Design and Production to Usage, and End-Of-Life. Next, we will lead an ideation and prototyping session, followed by an interdisciplinary discussion reflecting on how intelligent technology can promote sustainable mobility. The outcomes will include potential design ideas and future research directions for incorporating life-cycle considerations into future mobility solutions.
